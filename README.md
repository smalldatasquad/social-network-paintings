**What is the self-portrait of a society?**

On social media, you are an individual who forms relationships with other individuals. You follow, link, like, subscribe. 
A model of a social network understands society as a series of interconnected networks, graphs, spider webs. Individuals are circular nodes, relationships are lines or edges, and networks are portrayed as linkages between nodes. With a social network, the data is the message: both a visual representation, and a database structure.
Embedded in this node-and-edge paradigm is an underlying presumption that humans are individuals first, and that society, groups, and cultures then arise as result of individual groupings: That society is, supposedly, *what emerges when you connect a group of individuals.*

But is this really the case? We pay attention to what our closest friends pay attention to. We adopt the habits of our loved ones. We are affected by people, forces, and ecologies weâ€™ve never known. We are beings formed by our societies, our systems, our cultures. 

**Social Network Paintings** is an exploration of the most common representations of social networks and the ways the database as form has influenced these representations. We will get our hands dirty with paint and software to make and remake social networks and societies. What are the conceptual assumptions and gaps in the network-form? How can these forms be misused, reappropriated, and decontextualized to represent other modes of experience? How can painting, poetry, and performance be a models for representing our societies?
